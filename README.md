## Roadmap
- Tools for mass management of tab-separated-data for nouns, verbs, adjectives
  - Plural forms of nouns will have their own entry in the noun data with a plural gender
  - Plural forms of nouns will have a back-reference to the singular form IF it exists, vice versa for singular forms
- Tools for mass generation of beautifully formatted Anki cards/HTML formatted annotations on cards instead of this console-colors annotations view
   Acts a supplement for the existing mode and future modes added
- More learning modes:
  - Diacritics alt codes
  - Pluralise the singular form
  - Singularise the plural
  - Gender the noun (inc. telling if something is in the plural gender)
